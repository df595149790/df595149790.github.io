### Design


#### Slot & Item

We designed "Slot & Item" mechanics. 

The "Slot" is HUD button pressed by user on the right bottomer cornor. 
The "Item" is any action can be performed by player, such a Weapon, Skill, BUFF. 

Let us think about Gun. "Slot" is same like Armo, "Item" is same like Bullet. 
If user press a "Slot" which filled by "Item", then the "Item" whill be shoot out from the "Slot". 

The shooting result is determined by the "Item" type. 
For example, if the "Item" is a Skill, then the player will perform the special Skill operation. 

"Slot" can be upgraded, then the shooting count will be changed. 

There are three type of shooting count, empty, limited and unlimited. 
* The empty count means no shooting action can be triggered. 
* The limited count ranges from 1 to 6, and the Item action will triggered immediately, then the remaining shooting count descreased by one.
* The unlimited count can be shoot forever, but CD time is needed between two triggered actions.

where "Item" come from? "Item" will drop when player killed a enemy. Different enemy drops different "Item".
Where "Slot" come from? "Slot" can be brought in the game shop.

So, why we design "Slot & Item"?
We think this design will give players more policies to configure their equipment. 
* "Empty Slot", means players can fill any Items they want, such as Skills, Buffs, Weapons. Different Item has different effect. 
* "Limited Count Slot", means the Item filled can be collected and shooted at any time. This is usefull for player. Player can collect different Item during the fighting, and shoot it out to kill emeny. Then they collect a new Item and shoot again. This provide the "Agile" effect for player to fighting.
* "Unlimited Count Slot", means the Item is fixed. If player think some Item is very useful, they can permenent the Item usage by using this slot.
