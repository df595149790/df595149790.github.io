### Level Design

We design the world of game. 

The first chapter world is city, the second chatper world is hill.

We want connect all the level continues in one chapter. 
So we design the whole route first for the chapter, then design the level in more detail.

##### Chapter 1 : City

This chapter is the first level we trid for this game, so it is not fully documented.

We are not draw the overview route map in paper, but in our mind. 

Some levels are desiged in paper, some levels not in paper but in the Level Stduio created by us. 

Following are the levels we included in the final game.

[Room]( /cike/image_en/level.city.room.jpg )

Following are some levels we designed and tested, but not included in the final game, for the bad experiences.

[Escape]( /cike/image_en/level.city.escape.jpg )

During the game developing process, we created a Level Studio which can design level visually. 
So we designed some levels directly in our Level Studio, not in paper. 
These levels are not listed here. 


##### Chapter 2 : Hill

This chapter is fully thought and documented.

Player will acorss a bamboo forest, and climbing a rock hill, then jump across the huge trees to reach a wood bridge, 
then across the bridge and jump down into the lake, and reach the buddha stone, then fighting with The Shexie BOSS.

Following is the total route map.
