All the bosses are unique and designed on the base of special prototypes of China Ming Dynasty in real history. They stand in your way with different look, different thought, different weapon and different power. You mast conquer each of them with your best efforts. 

You will find many traps, some are easy, some are very difficult. Tricks dealing the traps are hidden for you to discover. 

There are many terrains in the game world. You will walk into city, mountain, lake, forest, cave, volcano, and Royal Palace. Different terrain has different traps and enemies. Remember to use the terrain feature while conquering bosses in your way.
