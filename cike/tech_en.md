Let's talk about techniques. I like it.

We have created a Fighting Game Engine during our game developing process. OK, I have heard the Clapping..... :)

This engine is Platform-Independent, including Mac/Windows/IPhone/Android.

For develpers, they can debugging and tracing thire game logic on PC, 
then running on Mobile after loading parameters dynamically, and watching the effect immediatelly.

For designers, they can use the Level Studio during their game designing process.
The design operation in Level Studio is visually, many elements can be created and put on the right place, 
including Layers, Animations, Particles. If designer want more complex and dynamic logic between these elements, 
they can use the script language provided by the Level Studio.  
For example, the game story animation or dialogue, can be created by these way.

Since the engine is used for Fighting Game, so many default parameters are provided. 
Designers can adjust the parameters they needed,  not from the scratch.
There parameters make the implementation of many features for Fighting Game becomes easy,
such as game pace and kill feeling.

Also we provided a GameMore framework which will report the data to cloud during the game playing.
Designer can ananlyze the data then improve user experience.

Maybe I need to talk the technique detail in another articles :)
