### Founder ( David )

#### Introduction

Serial Entrepreneur, Technique Expert, Trekker, Explorer.  


#### Achivement

All companies I have co-founded are focused on technology. 

The first company is TopWave created at 2002 by 2 friends and me. I was CTO in Topwave. This company provided Enterprise Solution in Telecommunication and was sold at 2004. 

After that another friend and I created the second company, Silvercreek. I played the role of CTO.  Silvercreek was one of the major Mobile Solution Provider in China, especially in Mobile Lottery service. At 2011 It was sold to a Public Company in HK market.    

In 2012 Alex and I created a new company, DooyoGame, focused on Game Development. We created a lot of games, including Casual, SLG, Puzzle, Arcade and Action. Most of the game is running on Mobile platform, such as IOS and Android.    

From 2018 Alex and I realized that Education has a lot of problems, especially in the field of Knowledge Sharing. So we think perhaps we can solve it through technology. Then at 2019, Classkull is founded by us to make our idea into reality.

### Product

#### Main

We will provide a platform for knowledge teaching and sharing. 

The core part of platform is a model database which represents the knowledge Human understood by now. We will init the model by computer algorithm in the area of Natural Science such as Math, Chemical, Physics. We think these type of knowledge is suitable for Machine to maintain and teaching without human involving. Multiply methods are provided for people to interactive with knowledge, including AR, VR, Gesture, Voice, Text, Animation and Free Operation, such as Scale, Rotate, Transform, Split and Merge.  A user can add annotation into the model to create a Self-Branding knowledge, and get financial return if other users like it.  The income of platform is mainly based on the charging fees paid by the users. 



#### To IE

We think this product is a the future of Education. 

Current education method has a lot of problems. A professional people must be existed to teaching common knowledge to other fresh people. Different people has different understanding to the same knowledge. Imagination is very important for fresh people to learn knowledge, the learning curve is leap at most of the time for beginners. 

So what should we do? We think Game-Like and Self-Exploring is the suitable methodology. Then the machine prepared knowledge is the key element for teaching. The most suitable knowledge type is solid knowledge, or the natural science knowledge. But how to combine the knowledge and teaching? Multiply natural interactive method should be provided, including AR, VR, Voice, Text, Gesture,  and Free Operation such as rotate, scale, transform, split and merge. OK, How to keep people stay and like to use the platform? Economics mechanism should be provided. People will get return if they give to the platform and other people. We think this is the future education, especially in nature science knowledge. Humans will only exchange emotion and feeling, or love, not the solid knowledge, in the future education activities.  This will make our society become more harmonious, our human species move more fast. 

We think IE can play an important role in these scenario and get unlimited returns during the process. We want to make this idea to be reality under the help of IE. Thanks. 

#### Competition

There are lots of solution in Education. But we think only some of them can compete with us, such as PhET and Khan Academy. 

The first competition is PhET ( phet.colorado.edu ) . This site have build a lots interactive courses for student to learn by using Self-Experiment method on PC. We like the idea of PhET. But we think it is too simple and not structured in system. Also it is a free website, so users trend to stay a very little time and leave. PhET lack business design. 

The other competition is Khan Academy ( www.khanacademy.org ) . They provide a lot of video courses for students to learn. But no interactive, no asking and no answer in realtime. The content of Khan courses if almost blackboard content, a tradition method. The difference of Khan course and common education is only the difference of teachers.
 
We think there is nothing else competition who provide the product like us. 


#### Advantage

The first advantage is knowledge type. Solid knowledge will be maintained by machine, or just say, Algorithm. These knowledge is discovered by human for a long term before and changed very slow, including Math, Physics, Chemical and all other Nature Science. We will build the knowledge model by algorithm. 

The second advantage is interactive method. User can operate the knowledge model freely in 3D representation by the nature human ways, including Gesture, Voice, Text. We will make user in immerse scenario by the help of AR and VR. In that environment user can do any explorer actions to model, such as scale, rotate, transform, split and merge. Also user can annotate on the model, and see other users annotation. 

The third advantage is economics mechanism. User contribute to our platform will get return as award, such as Token and Reputation. We will provide a TOKEN Ecosystem to support this design.  

We think education is a necessary part for every person. But people want an interesting way to learn. We provide the solution and will be liked by common people. 
       
#### Opportunities

Learning is boring for most of people, but also a necessary part for people. 
How about an interesting way to learn? People will like to pay for it. 


#### Metrics

Some metrics is useful to measure the success of our product. 
1. Is user like our product : DAU ( Daily  Active Users )  and MAU ( Monthly Active Users )
2. Is user like to pay on platform: Paid User CVR ( Conversion Rate )

Now we are not in the product operation phase. But we think we can image the numbers according to some related area, such as Education and Game. We can guess the DAU, MAC and Paid User CVR from MOOK, Khan Academy and School. We have some calculations about China in our BP document .   

#### Money

We want $60,000 as the Angel-Investment. 

These money is used to build the core platform out and test it in restricted range, hire software engineers, rent office, and other must-have  things ( such as accounting affaires ).  

#### More

We think our product is a future of Education, and we want to make it become reality. So can we do it? According to our background, we think technique is not the problem, and the market requirement is truly existed. But we need money to start making the product. We have designed the product in outline, including mainly user interactive flow, core system architecture, and implementation stage. If we can get the help from IE, more detail design and real building can be processed. Thanks to IE in the prior.
