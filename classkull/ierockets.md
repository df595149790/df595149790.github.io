### Founder ( David )

#### Introduction

Serial Entrepreneur, Technique Expert, Trekker, Explorer.  


#### Achivement

All companies I have co-founded are focused on technology. 

The first company is TopWave created at 2002 by 2 friends and me. I was CTO in Topwave. This company provided Enterprise Solution in Telecommunication and was sold at 2004. 

After that another friend and I created the second company, Silvercreek. I played the role of CTO.  Silvercreek was one of the major Mobile Solution Provider in China, especially in Mobile Lottery service. At 2011 It was sold to a Public Company in HK market.    

In 2012 Alex and I created a new company, DooyoGame, focused on Game Development. We created a lot of games, including Casual, SLG, Puzzle, Arcade and Action. Most of the game is running on Mobile platform, such as IOS and Android.    

From 2018 Alex and I realized that Education has a lot of problems, especially in the field of Knowledge Sharing. So we think perhaps we can solve it through technology. Then at 2019, Classkull is founded by us to make our idea into reality.



### Product

#### Main

We will provide a platform for knowledge teaching and sharing. The core part of platform is a model database which represents the knowledge Human understood by now. We will init the model by computer algorithm in the area of Natural Science such as Math, Chemical, Physics. We think these type of knowledge is suitable for Machine to maintain and teaching without human involving. Multiply methods are provided for people to interactive with knowledge, including AR, VR, Gesture, Voice, Text, Animation and Free Operation, such as Scale, Rotate, Transform, Split and Merge.  A user can add annotation into the model to create a Self-Branding knowledge, and get financial return if other users like it.  The income of platform is mainly based on the charging fees paid by the users. 



#### To IE

I think this product is a the future of Education. Current education method has a lot of problems. A professional people must be existed to teaching common knowledge to other fresh people. Different people has different understanding to the same knowledge. Imagination is very important for fresh people to learn knowledge, the learning curve is leap at most of the time for beginners. So what should we do? We think Game-Like and Self-Exploring is the suitable methodology. Then the machine prepared knowledge is the key element for teaching. The most suitable knowledge type is solid knowledge, or the natural science knowledge. But how to combine the knowledge and teaching? Multiply natural interactive method should be provided, including AR, VR, Voice, Text, Gesture,  and Free Operation such as rotate, scale, transform, split and merge. OK, How to keep people stay and like to use the platform? Economics mechanism should be provided. People will get return if they give to the platform and other people. We think this is the future education, especially in nature science knowledge. Humans will only exchange emotion and feeling, or love, not the solid knowledge, in the future education activities.  This will make our society become more harmonious, our human species move more fast. We think IE can play an important role in these scenario and get unlimited returns during the process. We want to make this idea to be reality under the help of IE. Thanks.
