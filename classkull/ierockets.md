#### Achivement

All companies I have co-founded are focused on technology. 

The first company is TopWave created at 2002 by 2 friends and me. I was CTO in Topwave. This company provided Enterprise Solution in Telecommunication and was sold at 2004. 

After that another friend and I created the second company, Silvercreek. I played the role of CTO.  Silvercreek was one of the major Mobile Solution Provider in China, especially in Mobile Lottery service. At 2011 It was sold to a Public Company in HK market.    

In 2012 Alex and I created a new company, DooyoGame, focused on Game Development. We created a lot of games, including Casual, SLG, Puzzle, Arcade and Action. Most of the game is running on Mobile platform, such as IOS and Android.    

From 2018 Alex and I realized that Education has a lot of problems, especially in the field of Knowledge Sharing. So we think perhaps we can solve it through technology. Then at 2019, Classkull is founded by us to make our idea into reality.
