Thanks for your meeting last time, I am very glad to talk with you all.
After the thoroughly thinking of your suggestion, we have to metion some points as following. 

1. About our business model. 

Our customer are not real persons, they are company or organization. So our business model is 2B, instead of 2C. 
Based on this point, I think your suggestion has a big different with us. We sell product to business partines,  their order is a bulk of products instead of single product. So the order price is a total price, not as simple as the multiply of single price. That means the order price will much higher then the multiply of single price normally. Some additional service perhapes is needed, such as training materials, teaching arrangement. According to these real business mechanism, we have mentioned the Revenuse-Share cooperation between us, not the Single-Items-Payment cooperation. 

2. About the Uni-Logo.

As the 2B business model shows, the customers of our company will require our Dooyo brand. We can not provide a third Logo to them. We are not only do business with them for Tomplay music product only, but also other education products which are developed by ourself. So we think Uni-Logo is a more accpetable cooperation beween Dooyo and Tomplay, for we can instroduce Tomplay as our content producer to our business customers. 

Based on the above points, we think your suggestion is not accepetbale by us now. 
We like the idea of Tomplay and the product of Tomplay, we think the musica product can be prompted to more customers in china. So we want cooperate with Tomplay and try to push the product thought our customer network. But as we all known, market activity is difficult, the result can not be predicted simply before real action is taken. But should we try? or just forcast the number which not really existed yet? We think that the first important thing is to start, and we will get response from market, then adjust the our policy, and  try again. That is market behaviour loop. 


Maybe we can talk the cooperation more in the future.

Thanks for your time talking with me.

Sincerely,

David 
Dooyo CEO
