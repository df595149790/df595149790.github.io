# Dooyo

---------------------------------

**WRITE TIME :** 20190227

**SOME WORDS :** I recently want attend a meeting hosted by CSEM, and I received a mail from the organizer who want know what is Dooyo doing and who I am. I tried to explain the reason of attending this meeting for I like to learn the technology of SoC, Sensor and IoT. But she asked me to provide a more detail introduction for she is doubt about my technology background. OK, I do not known why they are so nervous about the attender. As I known, technology should be open, and Company should welcome anyone who like to learn and try its products. But I think this is also a good time for me to write my ideas. I have thinks a lot and discussed a lot with friends, without document. Thanks CSEM organizer for giving me the time to write down.

## About History 

**Dooyo** is a startup company created by **Alex** and **David**(me). 

Alex is a senior market expert. He has a strong background on market sales and policies with more than 15 years working experience. I am a technique man. I have decades years technique working experience, covering many fields, such as communication hardware and software, enterprise solution, mobile development and so on. I like technique things and interested in make life more easier by the help of technique. I treat myself as a Programmer, a Explorer, a Trekker, and a Creator.   

At the start time, we decided to make Independent Games. Alex and I are all like games, we like the the story, the action and the art behind it, especially fighting games. On the other side, game is a rapid developed area, not only the user experience and imagination scene, but also the technology. Many new technologies are used in game in the first, AR, VR, Gesture, Eye Tracking, Mobility, Wearable and so on. That is my interesting. I like technology, and want to use technology to change our life.    
 
 But, we have build a team during the development time since then. Our team evolves creative guys with different background. It is my pleasure to introduce some of team members here. Nalong is a our software architect, also a  technique problem solver in many areas. Wulong is a technique specialist focused on Hardware development and Driver software development, also a parent of a boy who was born after Wulong joined in Dooyo. Yiziyun is a designer for our game, and he like to see all sorts of Cartoons and Games. Kent is our artist, he like the beauty of violence and drawing roles with sprite of never give up! Of course I cannot mention all of our team members here, especially the memeber in coding, testing, operation and so on. Research and Development is always our major department.     

After the game production period, I start to realize the ability of our team. We team members are technique guys almost, we have the power of implementation, both hardware and software. And we want use our technique power to do something, to make our life more easier, to make world more beautiful. That is our truly mind after so long time of create production. We want make our steps beyond the scope of Game.

## Our Mind

OK, what should we do? Our team is good at technology, especially in AI, Iot, IOTA, and has a strong interesting on Robot, ExoSkeleton, Automatic Driving. So I think these direction is a good start point for us to explore. 

 After attending many interviews and discussions with so many people in these field, I made some directions suitable for our team to dive deeper in the future.

#### Machine Behavior Marketplace

Machine will be the future basement for our society. The live of people will depends on all sorts of machine, such as car, watch, phone and so on. We need keep these machines works well, then the producer need to keep track the data produced by their products. Also the owner of machine, i.e. every single person, need to keep privacy for themselves.

We want to build a marketplace for every machine to store, exchange information between each other. Other entities will be play a role on this platform. The entities can be any type of object, not limited to be human. For example, Manufacture will track there products, People will control the benefit of their machines after them is brought by him, Policy can query the data if some law issues should be solved, NGO can monitor the data and analyse it to find a better way to keep our planet. 

Economics will be used to be the running rule between the entities of marketplace to exchange their data. For example, People who own a car, can decide what type of information can be find by other entities, and what price will be paid if some entity want to see more detail. 
  

Sensor will provide the data source for the marketplace.

#### Recognition Planning Platform

Intelligent is a major part in the future machine society. Autonomous Driving, Auto Moving Robots, AGV ( Automatic Guided Vehicle ), all these sorts machine will need recognition ability by using all kinds of senors to know their situation. Then they need to make decision according to their designed target by human. The decision includes obstacle avoiding, path planning.

This is a complexity system, including software and hardware. We want to create a platform to implement all the dirty works.

#### AR Education Platform 

AR is a amazing technology, We like to use it in education. Dooyo has been established a solid platform for the chinese school, and we can provide more function based on this platform. According to our plan, AR will be used in the scenario of class teaching between teacher and students.

#### Autonomous Driving HUD 

HUD (Head Up Display) is a convenience device for human, especially in the scenario of Autonomous Driving. Passengers are sitting while car is moving. Some immersing experience is more suitable for the passengers at these time.  

Our HUD device can be installed on two positions in the car space. 

One position is the bottom of front windshield. This type HUD can be used in two ways. First, it is used to project road image onto the front window. Drivers ( Or Passengers in Autonomous Driving Scenario ) will see the situation information in realtime, such as Traffic Lane, Navigation Direction, POI Information and so on. The second usage, the HUD can also show the image out of the Driver's sight, such as situation just ahead the bumper bar which can not be seen because of hidden by the Engine Cover.   

Another position is the top of every car window. This type HUD is used to project image onto the car window. Passengers will see a AR immersing picture.

#### Human Leg Exoskeleton 

Knee is a fragile part in Human body. I realised this seriously when my right knee is hurt during playing basketball. During the painful days, I really want to a Metal-Leg to make me move more quickly.

#### Motion Combination Equipment 

I like sport including trekking, bicycle, climbing and swimming. But the nature is not created by one way. Always when I ride my bicycle on a plain road happily, then there must be a hill laid before me after several minutes. Sadly I have to down the bicycle, walk while push my bicycle, then climb up and down to the other side of the hill. I really want fly across the hill!
  
So I designed a machine which can be used in several situations. The following is a concept diagram. 

From the the first look, It is like a bicycle. Yes, it is a real bicycle. I can ride it. But if I pull out some connector, then the bicycle can be transformed to a drone. The two wheels of bicycle will be used as the drone rotor. I can bind the bicycle frame to my back, and control the drone using the bicycle handle bars. Also I can make the bicycle transformed into a thruster, and push it into the water. The bicycle wheel will be used as the underwater propeller blades. I will control the motor by using the bicycle handle bars also. 

Because of the machine's usage, I named it as Motion Combination Equipment, where Combination means function combination of Bicycle, Drone And Underwater Thruster.
