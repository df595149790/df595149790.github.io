**WRITE TIME :** 20190227

**SOME WORDS :** I recently want attend a meeting hosted by CSEM, and I received a mail from the organizer who want know what is Dooyo doing and who I am. I tried to explain the reason of attending this meeting for I like to learn the technology of SoC, Sensor and IoT. But she asked me to provide a more detail introduction for she is doubt about my technology background. OK, I do not known why they are so nervous about the attender. As I known, technology should be open, and Company should welcome anyone who like to learn and try its products. But I think this is also a good time for me to write my ideas. I have thinks a lot and discussed a lot with friends, without document. Thanks CSEM organizer for giving me the time to write down.

## About History 

**Dooyo** is a startup company created by **Alex** and **David**(me). 

Alex is a senior market expert. He has a strong background on market sales and policies with more than 15 years working experience. I am a technique man. I have decades years technique working experience, covering many fields, such as communication hardware and software, enterprise solution, mobile development and so on. I like technique things and interested in make life more easier by the help of technique. I treat myself as a Programmer, a Explorer, a Trekker, and a Creator.   

At the start time, we decided to make Independent Games. Alex and I are all like games, we like the the story, the action and the art behind it, especially fighting games. On the other side, game is a rapid developed area, not only the user experience and imagination scene, but also the technology. Many new technologies are used in game in the first, AR, VR, Gesture, Eye Tracking, Mobility, Wearable and so on. That is my interesting. I like technology, and want to use technology to change our life.    
 
 But, we have build a team during the development time since then. Our team evolves creative guys with different background. It is my pleasure to introduce some of team members here. Nalong is a our software architect, also a  technique problem solver in many areas. Wulong is a technique specialist focused on Hardware development and Driver software development, also a parent of a boy who was born after Wulong joined in Dooyo. Yiziyun is a designer for our game, and he like to see all sorts of Cartoons and Games. Kent is our artist, he like the beauty of violence and drawing roles with sprite of never give up! Of course I cannot mention all of our team members here, especially the memeber in coding, testing, operation and so on. Research and Development is always our major department.     

After the game production period, I start to realize the ability of our team. We team members are technique guys almost, we have the power of implementation, both hardware and software. And we want use our technique power to do something, to make our life more easier, to make world more beautiful. That is our truly mind after so long time of create production. We want make our steps beyond the scope of Game.     


## Our Mind

OK, what should we do? Our team is good at technology, especially in AI, Iot, IOTA, and has a strong interesting on Robot, ExoSkeleton, Automatic Driving. So I think these direction is a good start point for us to explore. 

 After attending many interviews and discussions with so many people in these field, I made some directions suitable for our team to dive deeper in the future.    


#### Automatic Driving Planning Framework
 

#### Automatic Driving Data Marketplace


#### Automatic Driving HUD (Head Up Display) 
 


 


## The Vision
