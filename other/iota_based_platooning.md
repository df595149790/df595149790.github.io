# IOTA-Based Platooning PoC 

---------------------------------


Following is a video described the PoC of Platooning based on IOTA. I like this idea. We know that the Self-Driving must be the future, but now we have encountered many difficulties, including technique aspect and social aspect. Technique is hard to reach our designed target, such as Object Detection, Decision Planning and so on. Social question is more obviously for we have not been ready to enter the age of Machine Human Hybrid Society. 

But how about let us move forward with a little step? Platooning is a good scenario to test this idea. The head car can be drive by human, the other cars can be drive by software. This solution can make technique become easier for the later cars only need to copy the control data from the head car. Of course situation should be considered for the algorithm to avoid the problems caused by the length of cars fleet.    

IOTA is a choice for this solution. Please watch the video bellow.
