一些我听说过或见到过在实盘跑的量化策略：

Kalman filters

Hidden markov models

Topological manifold learning

Non-linear kernel regression techniques

APT type factor models

Monte carlo options pricing techniques

Continuous time APT factor models with latent variables

Spectral techniques for doing bag of words extraction of factors from natural language corpus for generating forcings for stochastic partial differential models of asset dynamics

Pairs trading/mean regression statistical arbitrage strategies

Automatic graphical model construction (structural inference over dynamic Bayesian networks)

Reinforcement learning based pairs trading strategies

Information theory based investment strategies

Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 35, July 1956, pp. 917-26

Sparse over complete basis function methods for feature extraction

Applications 'information geometry'; a field on the border between information theory, probability theory and differential geometry; still very new

Anything that can be used to model or extract features from a time series
