# Dooyo

**WRITE TIME :** 20190227

**SOME WORDS :** I recently want attend a meeting hosted by CSEM, and I received a mail from the organizer who want know what is Dooyo doing and who I am. I tried to explain the reason of attending this meeting for I like to learn the technology of SoC, Sensor and IoT. But she asked me to provide a more detail introduction for she is doubt about my technology background. OK, I do not known why they are so nervous about the attender. As I known, technology should be open, and Company should welcome anyone who like to learn and try its products. But I think this is also a good time for me to write my ideas. I have thinks a lot and discussed a lot with friends, without document. Thanks CSEM organizer for giving me the time to write down.

## About History 

**Dooyo** is a startup company created by **Alex** and **David**(me). 

Alex is a senior market expert. He has a strong background on market sales and policies with more than 15 years working experience. I am a technique man. I have 20 years technique working experience, including many fields, such as communication hardware and software, enterprise solution, mobile development and so on. I like technique things and interested in make life more easier with it. I treat myself as a Programmer, a Explorer and a Trekker.   

At the start time, we decided to make Independent Games. Alex and I are all like games, we like the the story, the action and the art behind it, especially fighting games. On the other side, game is a rapid developed area, not only the user experience and imagination scene, but also the technology. Many new technologies are used in game in the first, AR, VR, Gesture, Eye Tracking, Mobility, Wearable and so on. That is my interesting. I like technology, and want to use technology to change our life.    
 
 We have build a team during the development time.
